    <strong>Summit History</strong>
    
    The PNW Drupal Summit is an annual event organized by Drupal professionals for professionals residing in British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, Idaho and Western Montana.  
    
    The Summit rotates annually between Seattle WA, Vanouver BC, and Portland OR.  The Summit started in Seattle (2009) with 150 attendess and then went to Vancouver (2010) and then <a href="http://2011.pnwdrupalsummit.org/" target="_blank">Portland (2011)</a>.  This is the fourth annual event being held in Seattle (2012), where it began. The 2013 Summit will be in Vancouver BC, unless organizers decide to put their energy into Drupalcon in Portland.
    
    The intent of rotating the event was to reduce the annual burden placed on the Drupal user groups in each location.  Up until 2009, each of the 3 cities were duplicating efforts every year to organize Drupal Camps. Each city contnues to organize events such as training for beginners and specialized events for business and designers, etc.
    
    
    <strong>Message for Drupal Beginners</strong>
    
    Because the Summit is organized for people with Drupal experience, beginners should prepare by taking some beginner courses before attending the Summit.  Sessions will not be designed specifically for beginners but many will be useful to beginners.
