This is the mobile application for the Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit 2011, based on the DrupalCon Chicago mobile app.  It was built using the Appcelerator Titanium mobile framework.

The original development team at Palantir.net for the DrupalCon app consisted of:

Larry Garfield (Lead)
Pat Teglia (Developer)
Jen Simmons (Designer)

The PNWDS app is being adapted by Pat Teglia.

It ships with a default copy of the session schedule for PNWDS, 2011.  In-app updates are possible for as long as the web site remains dynamic.
